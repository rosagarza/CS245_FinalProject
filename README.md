# CS245_FinalProject
This github was created by Team Dynamic KAPPRs for the Final Project of CS245 at UCLA. You will find that we have branched the original code of the CG-ODE paper, 
if users would like to see source. 
In addition, we have collated all of the data we used for this final project into two separate folders: mask mandate data,CS245 data,collection weather data.
Lastly, we upload all the jupyter notebooks used to by the team to run the model and collect data under the jupyter notebooks folder. In order to use, please change google drive directories appropriately.
